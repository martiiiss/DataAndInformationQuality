# Data and Information Quality Project 2024/2025
Data Preparation Pipeline:
A) We will assign a different dirty dataset to each group.  
B) You must execute a complete Data Preparation Pipeline on the assigned dataset with the following steps: 
1. Data Profiling and Data Quality Assessment 
2. Data Cleaning 
  a. Data Transformation/Standardization (bringing everything to the same format, detecting and correcting typos, 
performing wrangling operations, etc.) 
  b. Error Detection and Correction (dealing with missing values and the detection and correction of potential 
outliers) 
  c. Data Deduplication (detecting and handling non-exact duplicates) 
N.B. After cleaning the data, verify the desired quality level has been achieved (additional Data Quality Assessment â€” 
brief)
