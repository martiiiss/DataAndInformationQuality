# Data and Information Quality Project 2024/2025
We execute a complete Data Preparation Pipeline on the assigned dataset with the following steps: 
### 1. Data Profiling and Data Quality Assessment 
### 2. Data Cleaning 
  - Data Transformation/Standardization (bringing everything to the same format, detecting and correcting typos, 
performing wrangling operations, etc.) 
  - Error Detection and Correction (dealing with missing values and the detection and correction of potential 
outliers) 
  - Data Deduplication (detecting and handling non-exact duplicates)
